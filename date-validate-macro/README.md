### Rose date validation macro.
A Rose app with a validation macro to check the validity of datetimes. Tested with Rose 2019.01.5 and Rose 2.0rc2.dev. n.b. This flow.cylc file exists only to provide metadate to my GithHub actions script which creates the README.md for this repository: You should delete it if you use this app.
