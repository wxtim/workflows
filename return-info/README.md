### Passing Station Lists
Scenario -------- You have a task which retrieves data from a set of observation points and passes it to a data processing task. Some of the sensors are broken some of the time, and you want your data processing task to know which ones are working (or broken, the principle is the same). Methodologies ------------- 1.

Use a file in ~/cylc-run/workflow/share/<cycle>/ to store the data. More suitable if you want to store lists of many tens or more working sensors. There is no reason that the get_stations couldn
