### 5 day batch processing.
An example suite showing how Cylc could be used to collect data for blocks of 5 days, carry out some processing for each day, and bring the workflow back together again (perhaps to do some stats, or perhaps just housekeeping). It also sets `max active cycle points` and `spawn to max active cycle points` so that we can run lots of these days in paralell. Be aware that scaled up this may cause problems with Cylc committing a lot to memory. Kiwis, RuRu and Pua are animals native to New Zealand.
